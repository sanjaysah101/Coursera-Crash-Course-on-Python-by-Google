What is 100 attendance point?
The attendance score is 100 points for initial participation. Attendance must be checked in the attendance book within 24h hours based on UTC. If you check attendance, your attendance score increases by 2 points, and if you do not check attendance, your attendance score decreases by 3 points. Keep in mind that if you are absent for exactly 31 days, that participant will not be able to
join in the TimeStope permanently.

When checking attendance, third-party assets are compensated for visible advertisements.


 
When the attendance score reached a certain score, it does not decrease below that anymore. For example, if your attendance score reaches 300 points, 300 points will become a base camp, and only go up to more than 300 points, and if you do not attend, only go down until 300 points. There is a base camp for each section, and when it reaches 1000 points, the attendance score will never decrease even if you do not attend. From 300 points, the attendance core will not decrease even without checking attendance.

Attendance Score	Max Transfer (1 year)	Increasing Stope
0~299	50,000œÑ	0 days
300	500,000œÑ	+150 days
‚àë + 100	+200,000œÑ	+75 days
When the attendance score reaches a certain score, the transferable amount per year increases. For example, when the attendance score reaches 300 points, the number of sendings per year increases from 10,000œÑ to 500,000œÑ, and when it finally reaches 10,000 points, the number of sending per year is infinite and can be transmitted without limit.

All participants equally have the Stope (mining period) of 24 months. This is a way to provide fairness to members who sign up late in time. However, every time an individual invites 250 people, the Stope will be extended by 24 months, and the stope increases even if the attendance score reaches a certain score.


 
For example, when the attendance score reaches 300 points, 150 days increase, so the Stope becomes about 29 months (24 months + 150 days). In addition, when the score reaches 10,000 points, the scope becomes about 48 months (24 months + 730 days), and the Stope increases by 75 days every 100 points after the attendance score becomes 1000 points.

The end of the stope term means that the existing attendance score is reset to 100, and the witnesses I invited will disappear from the list. However, the ownership of the TIME that has been held until now is maintained. The meaning of the limitations of the stopeterm is to give equal opportunities to users who will join in the future and to encourage the steady activities of existing members who are already active as witnesses.
